### 1. **Understanding the Objective and Scope**
   - **Objective**: Demonstrate the feasibility of an AI platform that integrates multiple biomedical tools and databases with a no-code interface.
   - **Scope**: Integrate three biomedical resources (PubMed, UniProt, SwissADME) using different integration methods, develop backend microservices, create a no-code frontend, implement an AI agent for workflow orchestration, and log data provenance.

### 2. **Technology Stack Overview**
   - **Core AI/ML**: Utilize PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Hugging Face for any AI/ML components.
   - **Agent Frameworks**: Use LangChain for orchestrating multi-agent workflows.
   - **Backend Frameworks**: Choose between FastAPI or Flask for creating microservices.
   - **Frontend Framework**: Decide on React or Vue.js for the no-code interface.
   - **Containerization**: Use Docker for containerizing the application.
   - **Automation Tools**: Implement Selenium and BeautifulSoup for web scraping and browser automation.
   - **Data Storage**: Use SQLite for lightweight data storage.

### 3. **Deliverables Breakdown**
   - **Backend Adapters**: 
     - Develop API integrations for PubMed and UniProt.
     - Implement web scraping/browser automation for SwissADME.
   - **Frontend Interface**: 
     - Create a simple UI that allows users to input queries and view results without coding.
   - **AI Agent Module**: 
     - Design and implement an AI agent that can manage workflows across the integrated data sources.
   - **Documentation**: 
     - Prepare comprehensive documentation covering architecture, usage instructions, and lessons learned.
   - **Feasibility Report**: 
     - Analyze integration challenges and outline next steps for further development.

### 4. **Implementation Steps**
#### A. **Backend Development**
   - **PubMed Integration**:
     - Use the PubMed API to fetch articles based on user queries.
   - **UniProt Integration**:
     - Implement API calls to UniProt to retrieve protein data.
   - **SwissADME Integration**:
     - Use Selenium and BeautifulSoup to scrape data from SwissADME.
   - **Microservices**:
     - Set up FastAPI or Flask to create RESTful endpoints for each data source.
   - **Data Aggregation**:
     - Develop logic to aggregate data from the three sources into a unified format.

#### B. **Frontend Development**
   - **No-Code Interface**:
     - Design a minimalistic UI using React or Vue.js that allows users to input queries and visualize results.
   - **Result Visualization**:
     - Implement components to display data in a user-friendly manner (e.g., tables, charts).

#### C. **AI Agent Implementation**
   - **Workflow Orchestration**:
     - Use LangChain to create an AI agent that can coordinate the querying of multiple data sources and synthesize results.
   - **Multi-Step Workflows**:
     - Define workflows that involve multiple steps, such as querying PubMed, retrieving related protein data from UniProt, and analyzing properties using SwissADME.

#### D. **Logging and Traceability**
   - **Data Provenance**:
     - Implement logging mechanisms to track data usage and provenance for all queries and results.

### 5. **Testing and Validation**
   - **Functional Testing**:
     - Ensure that all integrations work as expected and that the no-code interface is user-friendly.
   - **User Testing**:
     - Gather feedback from potential users to refine the interface and functionality.

### 6. **Documentation and Reporting**
   - **Architecture Overview**:
     - Create diagrams and descriptions of the system architecture.
   - **Usage Instructions**:
     - Write clear instructions on how to use the platform.
   - **Lessons Learned**:
     - Document any challenges faced during development and how they were addressed.
   - **Feasibility Report**:
     - Summarize findings, challenges, and recommendations for future work.

### 7. **Next Steps**
   - **Review and Iterate**:
     - Based on testing feedback, iterate on the design and functionality.
   - **Plan for Scalability**:
     - Consider how the platform can be scaled or enhanced in future iterations.

By following this structured approach, you can effectively develop the Agentic AI-Enabled Biomedical Research Platform as outlined in the PoC brief.
