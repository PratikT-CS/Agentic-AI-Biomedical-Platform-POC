   - **Goal**: Demonstrate the feasibility of an agentic AI platform that integrates multiple biomedical tools and databases with a no-code user interface.
   - **Focus**: Ensure cost-effectiveness using an open-source technology stack.

#### 2. **Scope Definition**
   - **Integration of Biomedical Resources**:
     - **PubMed**: API integration for literature search.
     - **UniProt**: API integration for protein sequence and functional information.
     - **SwissADME**: Web scraping/browser automation for ADMET predictions.

#### 3. **Technology Stack Overview**
   - **Core AI/ML**: Utilize PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Hugging Face for any AI/ML components.
   - **Agent Framework**: Implement LangChain for orchestrating multi-agent workflows.
   - **Backend Framework**: Choose between FastAPI or Flask for creating microservices.
   - **Frontend Framework**: Select React or Vue.js for the no-code interface.
   - **Containerization**: Use Docker to containerize the application components.
   - **Automation Tools**: Employ Selenium and BeautifulSoup for web scraping.
   - **Data Storage**: Use SQLite for lightweight data storage.

#### 4. **Deliverables**
   - **Backend Adapters**: Create operational microservices for PubMed, UniProt, and SwissADME.
   - **No-Code Frontend**: Develop a simple interface for user queries and result visualization.
   - **AI Agent Module**: Implement an AI agent to manage workflows and data synthesis.
   - **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive documentation covering architecture, usage, and lessons learned.
   - **Feasibility Report**: Outline integration challenges and propose next steps.

#### 5. **Success Criteria**
   - Achieve functional integration of the biomedical data sources.
   - Ensure the no-code interface is user-friendly for complex queries.
   - Demonstrate effective AI-driven workflow orchestration.
   - Provide clear documentation for future development.

### Development Steps

1. **Research and Planning**
   - Conduct a detailed analysis of the APIs for PubMed and UniProt.
   - Investigate the structure of the SwissADME website for scraping.
   - Define the data flow and architecture of the system.

2. **Backend Development**
   - **Microservices**:
     - Develop a microservice for PubMed API integration.
     - Develop a microservice for UniProt API integration.
     - Implement web scraping for SwissADME using Selenium and BeautifulSoup.
   - **Data Aggregation**: Create a service to aggregate data from the three sources.

3. **Frontend Development**
   - Design a minimalistic no-code interface using React or Vue.js.
   - Implement input fields for user queries and result display components.

4. **AI Agent Implementation**
   - Utilize LangChain to create an AI agent that orchestrates the workflow between the backend services.
   - Implement logic for multi-step workflows and data synthesis.

5. **Testing and Validation**
   - Test each component individually (unit testing).
   - Conduct integration testing to ensure all components work together seamlessly.
   - Validate the AI agent's ability to manage workflows effectively.

6. **Documentation and Reporting**
   - Document the architecture, usage instructions, and any challenges faced during development.
   - Prepare a feasibility report summarizing the integration process and outlining next steps.

7. **Deployment**
   - Containerize the application using Docker.
   - Deploy the application on a suitable platform (e.g., cloud service or local server).

### Conclusion
This structured approach will help in systematically developing the Agentic AI-Enabled Biomedical Research Platform. Each step should be documented thoroughly to ensure clarity and facilitate future enhancements. Regular reviews and iterations will be essential to address any challenges that arise during the development process.
