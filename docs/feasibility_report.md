### 1. **Project Planning and Setup**
   - **Define Team Roles**: Assign roles for backend development, frontend development, AI integration, and documentation.
   - **Set Up Version Control**: Initialize a Git repository to manage code and documentation.
   - **Establish Communication Channels**: Use tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams for team communication.

### 2. **Technology Stack Preparation**
   - **Environment Setup**: 
     - Install necessary tools and frameworks (Python, FastAPI/Flask, React/Vue.js, Docker).
     - Set up a virtual environment for Python dependencies.
   - **Containerization**: Create a Dockerfile for the backend services to ensure consistency across development and deployment.

### 3. **Backend Development**
   - **Microservices Creation**:
     - **PubMed Integration**: Develop a microservice that uses the PubMed API to fetch articles based on user queries.
     - **UniProt Integration**: Create a microservice to interact with the UniProt API for protein data retrieval.
     - **SwissADME Integration**: Implement web scraping/browser automation using Selenium and BeautifulSoup to gather data from SwissADME.
   - **Data Aggregation**: 
     - Create a central service that aggregates data from the three sources and formats it for the frontend.
   - **Logging**: Implement logging for data provenance and usage tracking.

### 4. **Frontend Development**
   - **No-Code Interface**:
     - Design a minimalistic user interface using React or Vue.js.
     - Implement input fields for user queries and buttons for executing searches.
     - Create components for displaying results and exporting data.
   - **Integration with Backend**: Ensure the frontend communicates with the backend microservices to fetch and display data.

### 5. **AI Agent Development**
   - **Workflow Orchestration**:
     - Utilize LangChain to develop an AI agent that can coordinate multi-step workflows.
     - Implement logic for the AI agent to handle user queries, call the appropriate microservices, and synthesize results.

### 6. **Testing and Validation**
   - **Unit Testing**: Write tests for each microservice to ensure they function correctly.
   - **Integration Testing**: Test the entire workflow from the frontend to the backend and ensure data flows correctly.
   - **User Testing**: Conduct usability testing with potential users to gather feedback on the no-code interface.

### 7. **Documentation**
   - **Architecture Overview**: Create diagrams and explanations of the system architecture.
   - **Usage Instructions**: Write clear instructions on how to use the platform, including how to input queries and interpret results.
   - **Lessons Learned**: Document any challenges faced during development and how they were resolved.

### 8. **Feasibility Report**
   - Compile a report that outlines:
     - Integration challenges encountered.
     - Solutions implemented.
     - Recommendations for next steps and potential improvements.

### 9. **Deployment**
   - **Container Deployment**: Use Docker to deploy the microservices and frontend application.
   - **Hosting**: Consider using cloud services (e.g., AWS, Heroku) for hosting the application.

### 10. **Feedback Loop**
   - After deployment, gather user feedback to identify areas for improvement and potential new features.

### Conclusion
By following this structured approach, you can effectively develop the Agentic AI-Enabled Biomedical Research Platform as outlined in the PoC brief. Each step should be documented thoroughly to ensure clarity and facilitate future development.
